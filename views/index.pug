    h1 How to play
    p
      | The rules are pretty simple, it&apos;s just a slightly more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors. In your hand you have five cards, each with an element, a power and a color. Each round you play a card and if you win the round, you gain the card you played as a point. Your card wins the round if it has the element that beats your opponent&apos;s card (water beats fire, fire beats ice, ice beats water) or, if you play the same type of element, if you have the higher power. To win the game, you have to collect a minimum of three points, where either all the elements and colors are unique, or where the elemts are the same, but the colors are unique.
